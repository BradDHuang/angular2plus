    ngOnDestroy

Directives:

Attribute Directives vs. Structural Directives

Attribute D.
    Look like a normal HTML Attribute
    Only affect / change the ele. they are added to

Structural D.
    Look like a normal HTML Attribute
    but have a leading *
    Affect a whole area in the DOM

ng g d directiveName

Hierarchical Injector
    AppModule: App-wide
    AppComponent: all Components (but Not for other Services)
    Any other Component: the Component and All its child Component(s)

// Angular 6+
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class MyService { ... }
    The "new syntax" does offer one advantage though: 
    Services can be loaded lazily by Angular (behind the scenes) 
        and redundant code can be removed automatically. 
    This can lead to a better performance 
        and loading speed.
        
RxJS: Reactive Extensions For JavaScript

In the simplest terms, 
the tilde (~) 
matches the most recent Minor version (the middle number). 
~1.2.3 will match all 1.2.x versions but will miss 1.3.0.
The caret (^), 
on the other hand, is more relaxed. 
It will update you to the most recent Major version (the first number). 
^1.2.3 will match any 1.x.x release including 1.3.0, but will hold off on 2.0.0.
